```

The `load_data` function takes in raw data and creates a data object that can be accepted by various estimation functions. We use publicly-avaliable data from the HVTN 505 HIV vaccine efficacy trial as our example.

```{r}

data(hvtn505)

dat <- load_data(
  time = "HIVwk28preunblfu",
  event = "HIVwk28preunbl",
  vacc = "trt",
  marker = "IgG_env",
  covariates = c("age","BMI","bhvrisk"),
  weights = "wt",
  ph2 = "casecontrol",
  data = hvtn505
)

```

The `summary_stats` function gives us some useful summaries of the dataset.

```{r}

summary_stats(dat)

```

The `est_overall` function allows us to estimate overall risk in the placebo and vaccine groups, as well as estimate vaccine efficacy, using either a nonparametric Kaplan-Meier estimator or a marginalized Cox model.

```{r}

est_overall(dat=dat, t_0=578, method="KM")
est_overall(dat=dat, t_0=578, method="Cox")

```

The `est_ce` function allows us to compute controlled effects curves; see [Gilbert, Fong, Kenny, and Carone 2022](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article-abstract/24/4/850/7320953) for more detail.

```{r}

ests_cox <- est_ce(dat=dat, type="Cox", t_0=578)
ests_np <- est_ce(dat=dat, type="NP", t_0=578)

```

The `plot_ce` function produces basic plots of CR or CVE curves. These are returned as ggplot2 objects, so they can be further customized as needed.

```{R}

plot_ce(ests_cox, ests_np)

```

Use the `density` option to add a kernel density estimate of the distribution of the marker.

```{R}

plot_ce(ests_cox, ests_np, density=list(s=dat$v$s, weights=dat$v$weights))

```
