## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. The following changes were made:

**If there are references describing the methods in your package, please add these in the description field of your DESCRIPTION file in the form...**
- We have added the main reference to the description field of the DESCRIPTION file in the requested format.

**Please write TRUE and FALSE instead of T and F.**
- Completed.

**\dontrun{} should only be used if the example really cannot be executed...**
- We have replaced all instances of \dontrun{} with \donttest, as these examples take longer than five seconds to execute.
